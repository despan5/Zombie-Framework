# ZombieGame

# Overview

This is the framework for a Zombie Game in unreal engine that allows the player to shoot zombies, has animations to idle, shoot, and run, as well as take damage from the zombie. The zombie implemented also has animations for walking, running when it sees the player, attacking, and dying. The game is played with WASD to move around, space to jump, and left click to shoot.

I created this as a starting point for anyone wanting to make a zombie survival game of their own.
